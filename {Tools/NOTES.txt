All of the LoLFSBExtract stuff doesn't matter, they changed from FMOD to WWISE or something.

Use "java -jar RAFTools..." to extract the LoL directory stuff
Use Ravioli Game Tools to select all of the BNK files and extract to their own directories
Use dbPowerAmp or something to convert all the WAVs to MP3s
